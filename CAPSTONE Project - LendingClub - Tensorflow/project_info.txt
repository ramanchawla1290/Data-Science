PROJECT GOAL

Analysis of the historical data containing information on loans given out to borrowers and whether or not the borrower has defaulted (charge-off).
We will build a model that can predict whether a borrower will pay back their loan or not?
This way in the future when the company gets a new potential customer, the model can assess whether or not the borrower is likely to pay back the loan.

We will be using a subset of the LendingClub DataSet obtained from Kaggle:

LendingClub is a US peer-to-peer lending company, headquartered in San Francisco, California.
It was the first peer-to-peer lender to register its offerings as securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC),
and to offer loan trading on a secondary market. LendingClub is the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform.
